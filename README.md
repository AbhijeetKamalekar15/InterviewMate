# 🧑‍💻InterviewMate



### What is this app about? 🤔

This app is designed to help users prepare for job interviews by offering a customizable mock interview experience with AI. Users can set up their own interview by specifying details like the job title, job description, and tech stack relevant to the position they're applying for. The app then generates questions based on this information and simulates a virtual interview. Users can speak their answers using the speech-to-text feature, and after each response, they receive AI-generated feedback to help them improve their performance. It's a great tool for practicing interview skills in a realistic, interactive environment.
